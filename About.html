    <p>
        Raphulu Funanani grew up in a rural place called Vuvha. He started his schooling at Maguada Primary School and later attended Johannes Mulambilu Secondary School. After finishing secondary school, he went straight to Rwanda University. There, he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics.

        Raphulu's journey started in a small village, and he faced challenges like many in rural areas. But he worked hard and was really dedicated to his studies. His time at Maguada Primary School gave him the basics he needed to succeed.

        When he moved to Johannes Mulambilu Secondary School, he continued to do well in his studies, especially in subjects like mathematics, science, and literature. His teachers saw his potential and encouraged him to keep pursuing his love for maths.

        After finishing secondary school, he made his way to Rwanda University to study mathematics. This was a big achievement for him, as he had worked really hard to get there. During his time at the university, he focused on math and got even better at it.

        Rwanda University provided a great environment for Funanani to learn and grow. During my academic journey, I delved into various mathematical disciplines, including pure mathematics, statistics, and mathematical modeling.
        My enthusiasm for mathematics drives me to explore its practical applications in fields like data science and finance. His professors and friends saw his dedication to maths, and he continued to do well.
        After four years of studying and hard work, Funanani earned his Bachelor of Science degree in mathematics from Rwanda University. His success is a great example of how determination and a love for learning can help you overcome challenges and achieve your dreams.
